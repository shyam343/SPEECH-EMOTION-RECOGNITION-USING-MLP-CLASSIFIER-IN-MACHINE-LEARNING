Overview:-
         Speech Emotion Recognition (SER) is a field of study that focuses on developing algorithms and models to recognize emotions from speech signals. The use of Machine Learning (ML) techniques has become increasingly popular in SER due to their ability to extract useful features from speech signals and classify emotions accurately. In this Project, MLP (Multi-Layer Perceptron) is a type of artificial neural network commonly used in ML for classification tasks.

The "Speech Emotion Recognition Using MLP Classifier in Machine Learning" presents an overview of the SER system using MLP classifiers. The proposed system includes preprocessing of speech signals, feature extraction, and classification using MLP classifiers. The study suggests that the proposed MLP-based classification system can achieve high accuracy in recognizing emotions from speech signals.

The paper first describes the preprocessing of speech signals, which includes several steps such as noise removal, signal normalization, and segmentation. Then, feature extraction methods such as Mel-frequency cepstral coefficients (MFCCs) and Linear Predictive Coding (LPC) are used to extract relevant features from the preprocessed speech signals. These features are then used as inputs for the MLP classifier.

The MLP classifier is trained using a labeled dataset that includes speech signals and their corresponding emotional labels. The project describes the training process and the parameters used to optimize the MLP classifier's performance. The MLP classifier's output is the predicted emotion label, which is compared to the actual emotion label to measure the system's accuracy.

The project concludes that MLP classifiers can achieve high accuracy in recognizing emotions from speech signals. However, the accuracy of the system depends on several factors such as the quality of the speech signal, the feature extraction methods used, and the size and quality of the labeled dataset used for training. The study suggests that future research should focus on improving the accuracy of MLP classifiers by optimizing the feature extraction methods and using larger and more diverse labeled datasets for training.
